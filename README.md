# Poised-V4
Poised project tracker final version/SQL
This is my final version of my java based project tracker
This program allows a user to store data based on a construction company. this allows a user to store thing such as clients details, architects details, contractors details and each of these headings have values such as name, number, address etc
this all gets stored in a SQL database that i set up myself with various tables to store these values
With that the program also offers features such as create a project, update, delete, search and more
